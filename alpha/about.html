        <h3>History</h3>
        <blockquote>"If you like your dance virtuosic, spiritually uplifting and socially conscious, don't miss PHILADANCO."
        â€”The Philadelphia Inquirer </blockquote>
        <p>The Philadelphia Dance Company (PHILADANCO) was founded in 1970 by Joan Myers Brown. Created out of a need to provide
        opportunities for Black dancers, who were then systematically denied entrance in many local dance schools, PHILADANCO
        has since grown into a professional dance company that is recognized across the nation and around the world for its
        artistic integrity, superbly trained dancers and electrifying performances. Established on principles of providing
        opportunity, inclusion and hope, PHILADANCO bridges cultural divides and consistently performs for sold-out audiences
        representing an amalgamation of people from diverse ethnicities and communities.</p>

        <img src='https://placehold.it/400x250/000000' alt=''/>
        <p>With its home-base on Philadanco Way in West Philadelphia, PHILADANCO provides one of the nation's most innovative and
        successful dance training programs. A myriad of company support systems and intensive trainings enable dancers to
        develop their talent and refine their technical skills. Often described as "a miracle of skill and energy,"
        "fascinating and thrilling," and performers with "blazing physicality," PHILADANCO dancers are among the best of the
        best.</p>
