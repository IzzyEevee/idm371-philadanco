        <p>Foreseeing the need to cultivate young aspiring dancers (ages 15-23) who show promise of continuing towards a
        professional dance career, PHILADANCO created the Danco 2 (D/2) Apprentice Company. Through an extensive evaluation
        process, members of D/2 are selected and are then trained in professional level classes. D/2 performs locally and in
        the surrounding counties about 25 times each year and is featured in the annual Danco on Danco concert.</p>
