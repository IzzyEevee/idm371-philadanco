## Inspiration Sites

Here we're collecting websites that achieve what we want, or websites with mistakes we can learn from. Anyone can feel free to add a website that grabs their attention. Please also include what you like or dislike about the website.

### [Ballet x](https://www.balletx.org/)

**Likes:** It looks modern, and pulls the user in right away with a big exciting photo. All the most important information is on the front page, and the design varies enough to intruige the user to scroll more. The carousel view of "The Dancers" is presented in an interesting way, and it's nice to have the individual dancers introduced on the home page.

**Dislikes:** The website is overdesigned in some places, and the micro-interactions distract from rather than contributing to the goals of the site. On certain hovers, large areas turn bright yellow or blue, and they don't match and hurt your eyes against the dark color scheme.

### [Koresh](https://www.koreshdance.org/)

**Likes:** It feels modern and simple. The large video background grabs the user's attention and gives a feel for what the dance company is about. The upcoming events as well as the company's history and purpose are all on the front page. I feel like the grayscale colors add to the company's identity. The micro-interactions are simple and subtle which work nicely.

**Dislikes:** On the top navigation, "The Company", "The School", and "The Community" is repetitive because it is also right beneath; I was a bit confused at first as to why "The Company", "The School", and "The Community" were made to be buttons on the navigation while the rest were not buttons, just text. Certain images have low resolution.

### [Toledo Ballet](http://www.toledoballet.net/)

**Likes:**
* Clear color scheme: continuity
* Clearly defined navigation/heiarchy
* Easy to find contact information above footer

**Dislikes:**
* Mobile Navigation is hard to navigate through since every sub-section is listed
* Visually dated
* Inconsistency in advertising: (Tuti Classic poster vs. Ballet Season poster on Tickets/Events)
* Inconsistency in what side the sidebar is placed on
* The way the large footer is isolated with the 2 white bars

### [Academy of Dance Arts](http://www.academyofdanceartsmtpleasant.com/)

**Likes:**
* Clean design/aesthetic
* Phone number listed right there on the top
* Straight forward with the content

**Dislikes:**
* The staggered navigation (isn't centered, not much space between the rows)
* Calendar isn't interactive or able to add to my Google Calendar
* Confusing navigation with the photo gallery (there's two different moving pictures with a reel in the middle)
* Inconsistent photography (everything except for a few of the faculty photos looks high quality)

### [Axis](http://www.axisdance.org/)

**Likes:** It has a clean design and I like the font choices. The website is pretty simple.

**Dislikes:** The front page has no information besides a slideshow of pictures. Lack of micro-interactions make it less interesting; On the Productions page, scrolling through the page feels long & tedious. Adding some kind of animation for the text while scrolling down and/or adding a fixed scroll up to the top button would benefit this page. Scrolling down this page on mobile takes even longer.

### [Martha Graham Dance Company](http://www.marthagraham.org/)

**Likes:**
* Good use of space without too much stuff spread out in it (both desktop and mobile)
* Is actually readable on mobile using iPhone 5s (what Iâ€™m saying that the font size is big enough for one of the smaller screens)
* Looks very simple and modern
* The primary colors (white and black) helps bring out the other colors of the site

**Dislikes:**
* The white letters font on black background on mobile looks very thin but is fine otherwise when the opposite is there.
* Personal: have the main category page and its children be in a slightly unique layout. A lot of these pages are the same and not * visually uninteresting. Predictable
* Switches between purple and red accents
* Teens @ Graham - randomly has a purple background in the main and children pages instead of the more commonly used black on similar page layouts.

### [Wasatch Contemporary Dance Company](http://wasatchcontemporary.com/)

**Likes:**
* Simple and modern design
* Good use of space
* Not overwhelming in colors

**Dislikes:** 
* Weird formatting on mobilehttp://wasatchcontemporary.com/?page_id=368
    * Light pink background + white letters = unreadable
    * Even worse on mobile where the above is part of an image and becomes too small to read
* Last bullet above applies to all images with words in this website on mobile

### [American Ballet Theatre](https://www.abt.org/)

**Likes:**
* The intro video is a cool idea. At the beginning, this one reads more as an H&M commercial, I wish it started with amazing dance right away, but once it picks up, it's very captivating.
* The layout of the home page. In landscape on a computer, I like the way it is layed out as a big, central video (photo, logo, or design would work as well), with scrolling events on the side.

**Dislikes:**
* More on the video: As far as I can tell, it doesn't have sound. What is dance without music?
* Their color scheme. Gray, black, navy and beige is such a gloomy pallette for dance. Also, the neutrals detract from one another. They need a bright accent color.
